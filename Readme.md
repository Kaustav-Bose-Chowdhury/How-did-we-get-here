# Welcome! Grab a seat in my corner of the internet. Thanks for stopping in.
This project was the result of a few small mistakes that I made while setting up git for another project.  
Later I took the time to correct those mistakes and learn from it.  
I decided to notedown all that I learnt (which is a lot) in a file so that I can refer to it if I need to.  
Later I thought to upload it on Github (the unfinished docs) so that I can version control it properly and maybe (just maybe) to help others who face the same problems.  

## So what can you expect to find here
**For beginners :** You may find a roadmap to start the journey.  
**For beginners++ :** You may find solutions to your problems or learn something new.  
**For more experienced folks :** I do not think that there is much I can do. Although I would be glad to learn something new. You may also contribute to this.

>Note: This project is nowhere near complete and will probably be updated
